      <h5>Organization of session-II mocks- UPDATED (Posted on 17-SEP-2023)</h5>
      <p>Dear Aspirant,</p>
      <p>The paper pattern had been released by the ETS on 15th September 2023. There are a few amendments to the same. To avoid dragging of session-II mocks, it has been decided that both quantitative reasoning and verbal reasoning would be conducted together in the same paper with the combination being QVQV or VQVQ (this could vary with mocks). The number of questions however remain the same. 27 questions of QR and 27 questions of VR would be adjusted in the aforementioned combination.The duration of the test would be duration allotted previously for QR + duration alloted previously for VR. The same shall reflect in the notice given out on 15th September 2023.Please note, AWA shall be conducted separately on another day. The results for QR and VR would be made available as soon as the candidate submits the paper. Right answers and recorded responses shall be visible too.If any form of moderation has to be done, it will be visible along with the AWA scores and percentiles once released on the website. This process would take about 5 to 6 days.Also note, there would be no counselling after every mock as informed before; it shall take place with the best score out of all the mocks at the end of this session.There would be no headings when there is a change in section. The number of questions per section as per the given combination could vary with mocks as well as the ongoing mock.</p>
      <p>Thank you</p>

      <h5>Tie breaker guidelines (Posted on 10-SEP-2023)</h5>
       <p>The following tie breaker guidelines have been suggested: </p>
       <ol>
         <li>The initial subject to tie breaker is the score achieved by the candidate in quantitative reasoning</li>
         <li>The next subject to tie breaker is the score achieved by the candidate in verbal reasoning</li>
         <li>If the scores are still the same, then the scores achieved by the candidate in the AWA section would be considered</li>
         <li>If for some reason the scores still match, then the date on which the candidate registered would be considered as tie breaker. The candidate who would have registered earlier would stand out in terms of the same</li>
         <li>If the tie breaker still exists, the same position would be given to all the candidates involved.</li>
       </ol>
      <p>**This tie breaker exists in case there are multiple candidates for one seat.</p>
