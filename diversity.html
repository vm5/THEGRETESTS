<h2>A Message from our Chief Diversity Officer, Ida Jackson Woods</h2>
<h3>When our employees feel like they are respected and valued for who they are at work, we can cultivate an inclusive environment that fosters diverse thinking where employees feel empowered to speak up and share their ideas. This is the goal of our Office of Diversity, Equity, Inclusion and Belonging â€“ and we will continue centering our ETS culture on equity where all employees are recognized and celebrated for their unique perspectives, skills and lived experiences.</h3>
